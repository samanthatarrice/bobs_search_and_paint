<p align="center">This was a project I completed for Mintbean's November 2021 Hackathon. I just completed my first hackathon about week prior to this one, but this was my first solo hackathon project. As a new developer I mostly just used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Paint App - Becoming Bob Ross:</h3>
<p>Computers have been a boon for creativity and imagination. Digital art has, for decades now, been a medium in its own right; and with the advent of NFTs, the future might be very bright indeed for digital artists. Today, we'll build an app that lets your friends and loved ones express their creative side.</p>

<p>Today, your challenge is to build one of the below:</p>

<h4>⭐️ Frontend-only: <span><em>I opted for this frontend-only option since I still need to learn backend</em></span></h4> 
<p>Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:</p>

- As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
- As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

<h4>Full-stack (Optional)</h4>

<p>Broadly speaking: add a full-stack feature that makes sense for your application. Examples include:</p>

- Shareable art
- Saveable files
- User profiles with galleries of work

<h4>For teams with UX/UI Designers</h4>

<p>A big welcome to our first cohort of UX/UI designers! Your teams are super fortunate to have the vision and finesse that a designer can bring! To make sure you get credit for your work, please include your designs in a shareable format (PDF, Adobe XD or a public Figma is recommended). The best place to include this is on the application's landing page AND on the Github repo's README file. It's recommended that you also share your work on LinkedIn and Twitter, since this counts towards storytelling for you personally.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>I did not have a designer, but I do have some experience using Figma. My designs are linked below</strong></em></p>

<h4>Here are some achievable application inspirations on Codepen:</h4>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/HarryGateaux/pen/BApxl">HTML5 Drawing Pad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/cftflora/pen/xdAIw">Drawing from Dots</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/tigt/pen/xZEdoP">SVG Coloring Book</a></li>

<h4>Advanced applications, for further inspiration. We DO NOT recommend you build these...</h4>
