<p align="center">This was a project I completed for Mintbean's November 2021 Hackathon. I just completed my first hackathon about week prior to this one, but this was my first solo hackathon project. As a new developer I mostly just used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>📖 Paint App - Becoming Bob Ross:</h3>
<p>Computers have been a boon for creativity and imagination. Digital art has, for decades now, been a medium in its own right; and with the advent of NFTs, the future might be very bright indeed for digital artists. Today, we'll build an app that lets your friends and loved ones express their creative side.</p>

<p>Today, your challenge is to build one of the below:</p>

<h4>⭐️ Frontend-only: <span><em>I opted for this frontend-only option since I still need to learn backend</em></span></h4> 
<p>Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:</p>

- As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
- As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

<h4>Full-stack (Optional)</h4>

<p>Broadly speaking: add a full-stack feature that makes sense for your application. Examples include:</p>

- Shareable art
- Saveable files
- User profiles with galleries of work

<h4>For teams with UX/UI Designers</h4>

<p>A big welcome to our first cohort of UX/UI designers! Your teams are super fortunate to have the vision and finesse that a designer can bring! To make sure you get credit for your work, please include your designs in a shareable format (PDF, Adobe XD or a public Figma is recommended). The best place to include this is on the application's landing page AND on the Github repo's README file. It's recommended that you also share your work on LinkedIn and Twitter, since this counts towards storytelling for you personally.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>I did not have a designer, but I do have some experience using Figma. My designs are linked below</strong></em></p>

<h4>Here are some achievable application inspirations on Codepen:</h4>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/HarryGateaux/pen/BApxl">HTML5 Drawing Pad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/cftflora/pen/xdAIw">Drawing from Dots</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/tigt/pen/xZEdoP">SVG Coloring Book</a></li>

<h4>Advanced applications, for further inspiration. We DO NOT recommend you build these...</h4>
  <li><a href="aggie.io">Aggie.io</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.free-coloring-pages.com/online.html">Free Coloring Pages</a></li>

<h2 align="center">❓How To Use:</h2>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88330216/143303937-cb25c9d2-1efd-48dd-ab56-056fc0c9e8c5.mp4

<p>This app is only currently only designed for desktop use. It will work on some touch screen devices, like an iPad. You can open it on any web browser, it is just recommended to not use Internet Explorer:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look inside the TV screen to search for the items you see in the white vertical bar (the ☁️, 🐿, 🪴, and 🌲).</li>
  <li>When you find an image, click on it. You will see a new screen pop up where you can paint to color in the pages:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>🌈 - Click on the top knob to open the color picker. Choose a color.</li>
    <li>🖌 - Click on a brush to change the stroke size.</li>
    <li>✏️ - Click the eraser if you want to erase parts of you drawing.</li>
    <li>🗑 - Click on the trash can if you want to delete the whole drawing.</li>
    <li>⬇️ - Click the down arrow if you want to download.</li>
    <li>𝗫 - When you are done, click the black X in the top right to close the painting and search for more items.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>There are some hidden features as well. See if you can click on other objects to find them!</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="center">⬇️ Developer How To:</h2>
<p>If you want to use these files on your local device, and have Git installed, simply follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Tap on the green "Code" button in this repository to copy the SSH key (recommended) or HTTPS URL.</li>
  <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the directory (cd) you want to save this repository inside of (Example: `cd Projects Folder`).</li>
  <li>Once you are there type `git clone <this repository's SSH key or URL>` (replace the < > with the key or URL you copied).</li>
  <li>You should now see the clone inside the directory you saved it in. You can check by typing `ls` inside of the directory where you saved this repository.</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="center">🖥 Feature Updates:</h2>
  <p>☑️ Video popup and external controls when user clicks on Bob</p>
  <p>☑️ Free paint canvas when user clicks on palette</p>
  <p>☑️ Add effect to brushes when user chooses one so they know which one they are using (this will require changing brush file to individual files for each brush)</p>
  <p>☑️ Touch events for painting on tablets</p>
  <p>☑️ Eraser to painting feature <strike>(decided against this since it is supposed to be like a painting)</strike> </p>
  <p>☑️ Download option for coloring pages</p>
  <p>☑️ Deploy through another site (e.g. Netlify) to see if it loads faster</p>
  <p>&#9744; Make touch events work on mobile too, and refactor to match mouse events</p>
  <p>&#9744; Video pop-up behind TV of read-aloud when user clicks on Bob (with external controls)</p>
  <p>&#9744; Fix issue with download where popup shows more than once (once for every coloring page visited) after you choose cancel</p>
