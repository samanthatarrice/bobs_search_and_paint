# bobs_search_and_paint

TO DO:
- make TV bigger on smaller widths
- make fonts and icons bigger for smaller screens
- make image file sizes smaller
- create ReadMe
- create landing page
- clean up code

*Add Bob quotes! Possibly to landing page and read me...
- "We don't make mistakes, juat happy little accidents"


----

DO IF THERE IS TIME...
- add eraser...but maybe this goes against the painting style? (no mistakes)...possibly change style of brush so it paints over other colors.
- add more items in display to make things harder to find
- add custom cursors
- add free paint option
- change contact icons to be bigger on mobile
- if all items are found (all elements with .find class have display of none), then show reset button and script reset
- add different cursors when user chooses each brush size
- add texture to walls to look more part of the scene.

----

SHOULD I DO THIS...?
- add instructions when user enters drawing mode
- add instructions to start page

<div class="canvas-background"> //set display to block
  <img class="cloud-background"> //set each img display to block for each item
  <img class="squirrel-background">
  <img class="plant-background">
  <img class="tree-background">
</div>
